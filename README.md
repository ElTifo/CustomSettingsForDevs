# CustomSettingsForDevs

Original project here:

https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-code-project-5-0-rom-control-app-for-devs.3146567/

I've just picked up where they left and updated to latest Android Studio and gradle versions.


App is now AndroidX!


All changes on the code made by myself in order to get this app running on both Google Pixel 4a and Xiaomi Mi A3.
